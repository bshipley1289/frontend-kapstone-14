Overview
You will be working in teams to make a project of your choice from the list below. It is up to you to come up with a theme for your app. The goal is to create a portfolio ready full stack application. The application will have a react frontend and an express backend connected to a mock database. 

Project Choices
You and your team will have to choose which app to create from the following list. Your Product Owner must submit the Kapstone Project Planning form (Links to an external site.) by midnight on Monday, April 5th. We have included some feature suggestions and data models for each app, but you are free to make up your own.

Working on a Team
Team List - Find your team here (Links to an external site.).

Daily Scrum (Standup) Meetings - During this project, after you submit a standup form, it will appear here (Links to an external site.) so that your team can review the submissions during your stand-up meetings. The submissions will be grouped by Team Number so that you can easily find your team's submissions. Each member of the team is required to fill out a stand-up form so that they can be reviewed during the stand-up meeting by the team.

Slack - Each team has their own slack channel (seq2-kapstone-#). If you have not been added to your team's channel, let your facilitator know.

A large portion of your grade will be based on your ability to work on a team. This includes a team peer review, your assignments on the SCRUM board, your commits to the repository, and your attendance at daily team stand-up meetings and the end of sprint demos.

Git Strategies for Groups
Scrum and Agile Basics

Getting Started
Take the first day to plan the project. After the first day of planning, your Product Owner should submit the Kapstone Project Planning form (Links to an external site.).

For day 1:

Decide on scrum roles. Be sure to account for a Product Owner, a Scrum Master, and a Quality Assurance Tester.
Decide on a project from the four shown above.
Decide on the target features and data for your MVP
The scrum master should initialize the frontend and backend repositories and invite all team members as collaborators. We suggest keeping them in separate repos for this project. The frontend will be a create-react-app app and the backend will be an express app. Your github project board should be kept in the frontend repo as this will be a mostly frontend project.
Hold a pre-scrum planning meeting, populate the backlog on the project board, and fill out the Kapstone Project Planning form (Links to an external site.).
Team Demos
Your team will be required to give 3 short demos for this project: 1 after each week-long sprint. Demo dates are tentatively shown below:

April 9 
April 16th
April 23
Submission
Your product owner will be the only person to submit this project and every team member will receive a grade for this submission. Your team must submit the assessment before the due date. You cannot submit this assessment after the due date (April 23rd, midnight ET).

Product Owner's should submit the following links:

GitHub repo URL - this is the url that has your source code
Deployment URL - this is the url that has your deployed app, we suggest deploying with github pages (we will demo this in week 2 of the project).
Github Project board URL - this shows your Scrum board which has tickets with descriptions and assignees.
Retrospective Notes from each sprint - either a markdown file in your repo or a google doc
